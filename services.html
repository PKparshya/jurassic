        <p>Jurassic World is a 2015 American science fiction action film.[5] It is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and the first installment in the Jurassic World trilogy. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow, and produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, the film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan. Set after Jurassic Park III and 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, which is located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where a theme park of cloned dinosaurs has operated for nearly a decade. The park plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage.</p>

          <h2>Dino Park</h2>
          <p>
            Jurassic World was the fully functioning theme park on Isla Nublar, which opened to the public in 2005. The main attractions of the park were living dinosaurs, cloned by InGen's Dr. Henry Wu. 
            
            Inspired by, and built over, the original park, Jurassic World contained elements of a biological preserve, a safari, a zoo, and a theme park similar to Disneyland, Walt Disney World and all of Universal Studios' locations. The park, like the aforementioned parks, also functioned as a luxury resort with hotels, restaurants, nightlife and even a golf course.[2] By 2015, the park hosted over 20,000 visitors each day, while its hours of operation were from 8AM until 10PM</p>
