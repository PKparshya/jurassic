            <h2>Palaeontology</h2>
            <p>The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology (RTMP), named in honour of Joseph Burr Tyrrell, is a palaeontology museum and research facility in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. The museum is situated within a 12,500-square-metre-building (135,000 sq ft) designed by BCW Architects at Midland Provincial Park.

              Efforts to establish a palaeontology museum were announced by the provincial government in 1981, with the palaeontology program of the Provincial Museum of Alberta spun-off to help facilitate the creation of a palaeontology museum. After four years of preparation, the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology was opened in September 1985. The museum was later renamed the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in June 1990, following its bestowal of the title "royal" from Queen Elizabeth II. The museum's building was expanded twice in the 21st century. The first expansion was designed by BCW Architects, and was completed in 2003; while the second expansion was designed by Kasian Architecture, and was completed in 2019.
              
              The museum's personal collection includes over 160,000 cataloged fossils, consisting of over 350 holotypes. The museum displays approximately 800 fossils from its collection in its museum exhibits. In addition to exhibits, the museum's fossil collection are also used by the museum's research program, which carries a mandate to document and analyze geological and palaeontological history.</p>

            <h1>Universal Studios </h1>
            <h2>Hollywood</h2>
            <p>Universal Studios Hollywood is a film studio and theme park in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County, California. About 70% of the studio lies within the unincorporated county island known as Universal City while the rest lies within the city limits of Los Angeles, California. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA".[1] It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios sets and is the first of many full-fledged Universal Studios Theme Parks located across the world.

              Outside the theme park, a new, all-digital facility near the Universal Pictures backlot was built in an effort to merge all of NBCUniversal's West Coast operations into one area. As a result, the current home for KNBC, KVEA and NBC News with Noticias Telemundo Los Angeles Bureaus with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by Technicolor SA. Universal City includes hotels Universal Hilton & Towers, the Sheraton Universal Hotel, and Universal CityWalk, which offers a collection of shops, restaurants, an 18-screen Universal Cinema and a seven-story IMAX theater. In 2017, the park hosted 9.056 million guests, ranking it 15th in the world and 9th among North American parks.[3]</p>

            <h2>Münchehagen</h2>
            <p>Bereits wissenschaftliche Publikationen aus der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts belegen Funde von fossilen Dinosauriertrittsiegeln in den Rehburger Bergen, Teil des Gebiets des seit 1925 betriebenem Wesling Steinbruchs.

              Im Jahr 1980 wurde über einem Teil des Geländes, auf dem fossile Trittsiegel von Dinosauriern gefunden wurden, eine vorläufige Schutzhalle errichtet. 1987, kurz vor der Unterschutzstellung der Steinbruchfläche und des angrenzenden Feuchtbiotops als Naturdenkmal, erfolgte die Einzäunung des Gebiets.
              
              1990 stellte die niedersächsische Landesregierung Mittel zur Errichtung einer großräumigen Schutzhalle zur Verfügung. Unterstützt wurde das Projekt durch den Landkreis Nienburg, der niedersächsischen Sparkassenstiftung und des „Förderkreises Saurierfährten Münchehagen“. Die Schutzhalle wurde 1993 der Öffentlichkeit übergeben.
              
              Zeitgleich gründeten Ferdinand Wesling sen. und Bernd Wolter eine Dinosaurier-Park Gesellschaft, die den Grundstein für das Freilichtmuseum lieferte. Der Dinosaurier-Park eröffnete 1992, noch vor der erneuerten Schutzhalle.</p>

            <h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
            <h2> The Ride</h2>
            <p>Jurassic Park: The Ride is a water-based amusement ride based on the Steven Spielberg 1993 film Jurassic Park and Michael Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name which the film is based on located at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, Japan. It was formerly located at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California, where it was turned into Jurassic World: The Ride.

              The ride was researched and built as the film was still in production and opened at Universal Studios Hollywood on June 21, 1996. Duplicates of the ride have since been built at Universal's Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan as Jurassic Park River Adventure. A river rapids ride version, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, opened at Universal Studios Singapore in 2010.</p>

              Museum </h2>
            <p>The Museum of Natural Sciences was founded on 31 March 1846, as a descendant of the Musée de Bruxelles of 1802. It was based on the collection established by Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, dating from the 18th century. Belgian scientist and politician Bernard du Bus de Gisignies became the first director of the museum in 1846, and on this occasion, he donated 2,474 birds from his own collection to the museum.

              In 1860, during the construction of new fortifications around Antwerp, several fossils were found, mainly of whales, and they were acquired by the museum. The museum also obtained the skeletons of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and a young blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which are still on display today. The same year, the skeleton of a mammoth was unearthed near Lier, and due to the prompt action of archaeologist François-Joseph Scohy, it was preserved and brought to the museum, where it has been exhibited since 1869. At that time, the only other skeleton of a mammoth on display was in the museum of Saint Petersburg in Russia.</p>
